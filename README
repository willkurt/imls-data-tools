ABOUT

I've been creating some tools to help process some public library data from the Institute of Museum and library services.  The tools in this collection are mainly for processing data found in the various formats found in the 'data files' section of this site http://www.imls.gov/research/public_libraries_in_the_united_states_survey.aspx

These tools are far from perfect, but I wanted to share as much of the work I'm doing with others, feel free to use these tools as you see fit.

Visualizations created from these tools will most likely end up on my 'Library Data' blog: library.tumblr.com
