library (constructed variable).  NCES calculated this value 
by prorating the library's population of legal service area

service areas (total POPU_LSA), and applying the ratio to 
the state-reported total unduplicated population of legal 
service areas.  The latter item, a single figure reported by 
the state data coordinator, is also named POPU_UND but 
is located on the State Summary/State Characteristics
